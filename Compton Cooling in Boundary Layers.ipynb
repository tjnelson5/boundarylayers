    "We have claimed in the past that accretion disk boundary layers may be cooled by ambient radiation.  The code below allows us to calculate this under various physical conditions.  If electon cooling via bremsstrahlung is more efficient that cooling via inverse Compton scattering, then the radiation from the boundary layer will reflect the post-shock temperature of the gas in some way.  However, if Compton cooling is more efficient, then the maximum energy of electrons in the boundary layer will be decreased, and we don't expect to see hard X-rays characteristic of the post shock region.\n"
